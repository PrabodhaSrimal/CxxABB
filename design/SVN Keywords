$ svn propset svn:keywords "Revision" source_file.c
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'source_file.c'
$


Subversion defines the list of keywords available for substitution. That list contains the following five keywords, some of which have shorter aliases that you can also use:

LastChangedDate
This keyword describes the last time the file was known to have been changed in the repository, and looks something like $LastChangedDate: 2002-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Mon, 22 Jul 2002) $. It may be abbreviated as Date.

LastChangedRevision
This keyword describes the last known revision in which this file changed in the repository, and looks something like $LastChangedRevision: 144 $. It may be abbreviated as Revision or Rev.

LastChangedBy
This keyword describes the last known user to change this file in the repository, and looks something like $LastChangedBy: harry $. It may be abbreviated as Author.

HeadURL
This keyword describes the full URL to the latest version of the file in the repository, and looks something like $HeadURL: http://svn.collab.net/repos/trunk/README $. It may be abbreviated as URL.

Id
This keyword is a compressed combination of the other keywords. Its substitution looks something like $Id: calc.c 148 2002-07-28 21:30:43Z sally $, and is interpreted to mean that the file calc.c was last changed in revision 148 on the evening of July 28, 2002 by the user sally.
